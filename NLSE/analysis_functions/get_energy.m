function energy = get_energy(u,N)
%
%Calculates the energy in the first N modes at each time step for the 
%solution matrix u

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Inputs:

%
%  u  =  N x length(t_list) array of Fourier modes at all timesteps
%
%  N  =  maximal mode to include when computing energy

%
%  energy  =  the energy in modes 1:N at all times
